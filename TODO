* TODO
- Write more tests
- Write documents
- Performance testing
- Error checking and exception handling
- Write web4r-mode for emacs
- Support more lisp implementations

* Pending issues
- Automatically specifying the source path  
(See src/config.lisp for detail. Is there a way?)

- Dynamically assigning shtml path for load-shtml macro
(It's gonna be much simpler if we just use a function or macro. I do complex things 
 to expand shtml codes, written in a separated file, with lexical binding.)

* Ideas (low priority, might be implemented)
- Rewrite the http server with iolib (non-blocking I/O) and make it as a comet server
- Javascript realtime error checking
- Ajax support
- Better design with CSS
- Implement cache system (use cl-memcached?)
- Implement pluralize and singularize functions for pclass name like rails (Do we want this?)
- declare types for better performance
